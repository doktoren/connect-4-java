==============

Connect 4 program that I implemented many years ago in Java.

Note that the rules are with wrap around and bounce.
That is, positions such as those below are won for X:

6 |               |
5 |               |
4 |               |
3 |   X           |
2 | X O X         |
1 | O X O         |
  \---------------/
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7

6 |               |
